This project is aimed at developing an advanced web application, building upon the foundation laid in a previous lab. It involves creating a feature-rich platform where users can interact with a variety of heroes, adding functionalities like account creation, hero list management, comments, and ratings.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Users can create accounts with email, password, and nickname, with password updates supported. Authentication is crucial for accessing various functionalities.
Hero Interaction: Users can search for heroes based on various criteria like name, race, power, or publisher. They can view detailed information about each hero and perform actions like adding comments or ratings.
Hero Lists: Authenticated users can create and manage lists of favorite heroes. Lists can be made public or private, with options for editing and deleting.
Admin Functionalities: Special user accounts with admin access can manage site-related tasks like user management, review moderation, and enforcing copyright policies.
RESTful API: The backend provides a RESTful API to support the frontend functionalities, ensuring smooth communication and data exchange.
Security and Policies: The project emphasizes security measures, including user input sanitization, JWT usage for authorization, and the creation of publicly accessible policies like security, privacy, and DMCA takedown procedures.
Technologies:

Backend: Node.js is used for server-side scripting, with MongoDB possibly employed for data storage. Express may be used for routing.
Frontend: A frontend framework like Angular, React, Vue, or Svelte is required for building the client application. Firebase may be utilized for authentication and database services.
Development Workflow: The project follows a structured workflow, starting with planning and database design, followed by API development and frontend implementation.
Overall, this project aims to deliver a robust and user-friendly web application, catering to both casual users and administrators, while ensuring security, scalability, and maintainability throughout the development process
